        <p>I'm an international student from the United States, currently enrolled in the 1<sup>st</sup> level of the
            Interactive Media Design program here at Algonquin College. Before starting this program, I worked for the
            State of Delaware as a State Education and Training Specialist and HR Analyst. In that role, I managed our
            website and designed online training content for other government employees about how our health insurance
            and other employee benefits worked.</p>
        <p>I've spent the majority of my career as a classroom teacher, primarily of high school English. Iâ€™ve also
            taught <abbr title="General Educational Development">GED</abbr> preparation classes and early childhood
            reading intervention for nonprofits in Wilmington, DE. I <em>really</em> hope to leverage the skills I learn
            in the IMD program to offer multifaceted educational content and services on my own terms.</p>
